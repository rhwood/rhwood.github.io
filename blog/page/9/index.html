  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first of what I hope will be a weekly report on the goings on with the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> packages carried by the <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> project.</p>

<p>Most of the ports in the GNOME Platform are at least at the correct major.minor version, if not the most current version, with a couple of exceptions:
* <strong>gnome-vfs</strong> gnome-vfs is a development version, as the current stable version requires a rigorous dbus, which MacPorts currently does not have. I have submitted some bug reports to the dbus project, trying to get dbus working.
* <strong>gnome-vfs-monikers</strong> This is a new package in GNOME, and just simply has not been ported yet. Anyone want to help?
* <strong>gtk-doc</strong> This package used to have some very nasty dependencies that neither the <a href="http://www.finkproject.org">Fink</a> or MacPorts projects got working well. It may be portable now, but I have yet to attempt it. Most ports that would use it gracefully work around its absence.</p>

<p>The GNOME desktop is slowly being updated to the current packages, although any efforts on my part are directed at getting the platform working well first. My lowest priority with the GNOME packages is getting previously un-ported packages ported.</p>

<p>As always, any assistance in getting the GNOME packages ported or existing ports updated is appreciated.</p>

<p>I have a semi-automated <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/macports/gnome.html">status list</a> of GNOME packages with the porting status. Packages listed as broken without comment are most likely on my machine at a more recent version than MacPorts is distributing as I have upgraded the port, but the upgrade has not filtered through the entire rsync process yet.</p>

<p>Report 1</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This afternoon Augusta and I rode Chrysta&rsquo;s bicycle to McIntire Park. I rode Chrysta&rsquo;s bike since the rear inner tube on mine had a leak at the valve, meaning that I have to replace the inner tube and can&rsquo;t just patch it. Augusta rode in the little German child seat that can be remounted on the bike or moved from bike-to-bike in, like, no time flat.</p>

<p>The route I took, since Chrysta&rsquo;s bike is unfamiliar, was a slower route down narrow side streets. It seems that the really choice properties in Charlottesville are all in this one neighborhood north of the University of Virginia, and are not on the main roads, but are down these side streets that sometimes seem to be mere alleys.</p>

<p>Once we got to the park, Augusta was, as is natural for a child her age, all over the playground. A girl there by the name of Tiara played with her, and Augusta allowed her to pick her up. Which of course meant that every girl Tiara&rsquo;s age needed to ether be allowed to hold Augusta (she wouldn&rsquo;t allow any but Tiara to hold her) or find some other small child they could hold. (Not happening either.)</p>

<p>Augusta did a lot of climbing up this one curved ladder that required that she somehow master turning around the ladder half-way up it. She is getting good at this although it is scary for me. She also at one point demanded that I climb the ladder, and I almost got stuck. I&rsquo;m simply too large for the equipment.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Things have been quiet of late. Its been more of the same-ol&#8217;, same-ol&#8217;.</p>

<p>I lie of course.</p>

<p>One of the realities of where I work is that basically I can&rsquo;t discuss what I learned there. Office gossip is always okay, but even then I have to check that I am not crossing the line and causing a breach or releasing information that can&rsquo;t be released. Like two weeks ago, I took a really interesting class on some of the hows and whys of my line of work, and the entire class is classified. Can&rsquo;t talk about it, write about it, and probably should not even think about it in unclassified environments.</p>

<p>That said, I have been working on driving a php-based website with data that is maintained using a Microsoft SharePoint Server. I have a generic PHP class that is used to gather data, but it remains somewhat incomplete, and I can&rsquo;t test it at home.</p>

<p>On the MacPorts side of things, I had been working on getting gnucash running in MacPorts, and then someone else got it working first. I ended up making his package a little more usable and committing his work to the CVS servers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday Augusta, my 2 year old daughter, climbed onto a bunk bed that is in her room (we got it used knowing that soon we will need the bunking capability) while we were not in the room, and then tried to get down by swinging off the side of the upper bed and lowering herself to the floor.</p>

<p>Only she is a bit small for that.</p>

<p>She screamed while hanging onto the bed and Chrysta and I rushed to her room, and once Chrysta had put her on the floor and was almost hysterical and admonishing her, Augusta just kept on saying &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About 6 months ago, I threw together a script to help me automate the process of updating a Portfile for a package from <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> ftp servers. I called the script gport and wrote it in <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> simply because I knew that language.</p>

<p>I have been using that script to maintain the GNOME ports for the <a href="http://www.darwinports.org">DarwinPorts</a> project, thinking all the while that it might be useful if it was more generalized, tweaking it and adding some features during this time.</p>

<p>I usually used the script with the <code>-o</code> flag so that its output would scroll past in Console.app, and sometimes with the <code>-k</code> flag so that I could return the output log after the script had successfully updated the port. (By default it deletes a log if the update was successful, but keeps the log if it fails. This has allowed me to scan my copy of the CVS repository when using <a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/cvl/">CVL</a> for update failures, as CVL flags files not in CVS with a blue star.)</p>

<p>This past weekend, I rewrote the script to be a little more robust, and to update any Portfile (although automatic version determination only works for GNOME FTP server-based ports) and renamed it to be a little more meaningful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This evening I published a new tool for <a href="http://www.darwinports.org">DarwinPorts</a> called portfile-update. Run from a directory containing a DarwinPorts Portfile, it will upgrade the port to the specified version. If run against a port that is downloaded from the <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> project&rsquo;s <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org">download server (ftp.gnome.org)</a> or one of its mirrors, it will automatically determine which is the latest stable release and update the Portfile to that version. Switches allow it to update the Portfile to an arbitrary or the latest unstable version from the GNOME servers as well.</p>

<p><code>portfile-update -h</code> provides usage instructions.</p>

<p>portfile-update is available for <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/darwinports/portfile-update.0.1.tar.gz">download in a tar.gz archive</a>. Unpack it and copy the three (3) files in the portfile-update directory to some directory in your $PATH (like /opt/local/bin) to use it.</p>

<p>Still to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a CVS server for the tools</li>
<li>Make a Portfile for the project</li>
<li>Add further mechanisms for automatically finding the most recent version of a given port</li>
<li>Code the ability to pass it a port name for upgrading instead of having to run the Portfile directory.</li>
</ol>


<p>Limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic detection of versions only works from the GNOME FTP servers.</li>
<li>Liable to crash when incorrectly run.</li>
<li>Needs to be run from the Portfile directory.</li>
</ul>


<p>Enjoy and please test!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My auto-status tool for the GNOME packages in DarwinPorts broke because GNOME&rsquo;s MD5 hashsum list for the official packages for 2.14.2 are different than for prior releases. Until I handle the change in my tool, the reporting is going to indicate that many of the binding packages are either broken or not ported at all when they do, in fact, work perfectly well.</p>
