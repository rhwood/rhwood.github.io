  <div class="entry-content"><p>My auto-status tool for the GNOME packages in DarwinPorts broke because GNOME&rsquo;s MD5 hashsum list for the official packages for 2.14.2 are different than for prior releases. Until I handle the change in my tool, the reporting is going to indicate that many of the binding packages are either broken or not ported at all when they do, in fact, work perfectly well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since my primary machine went down 2 weeks ago, I have had a chance (and a need) to reinstall GNOME from scratch with DarwinPorts. This has resulted in many bugs being fixed over the past week or so and with the exception of one bug related to a bad server (<a href="http://bugzilla.opendarwin.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8371">bug #8371</a>), I have managed to commit fixes into CVS.</p>

<p>We are beginning to see upgrade releases leading to the release of GNOME 2.14.2 appear, so the next week or so will be busy with upgrading existing ports to incorporate recent fixes (stable feature-based upgrades should not be appearing before September for the most part) and then I will be working on getting as much of the GNOME packages into a working state on DarwinPorts as I can.</p>

<p>Of Note:</p>

<pre><code>gstreamer
</code></pre>

<p>The gstreamer upgrades from 0.8.x &ndash;> 0.10.y are significant. gnome-media, a long-standing gnome package that only got into DarwinPorts in late April/early May uses gstreamer 0.10.y to play sounds and video in GNOME. Not all ported applications that use sound in GNOME work at this point however.</p>

<pre><code>gnome-vfs
</code></pre>

<p>The 2.14.1 version of gnome-vfs is not building right now, stopping a number of other ports from being upgraded as well.</p>

<p>I hope to be able to get back to really working on GNOME by Tuesday now that I have my primary (faster) computer back&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was disappointed.</p>

<p>I visited the museum on Friday, May 26th, prime time for school groups and such to be visiting museums and generally making a day of things, and seemingly half the museum was closed for one reason or another or exhibits/demonstrations/stations (what is the science museum equivalent of a single painting in an art museum?) were &ldquo;not operational,&rdquo; &ldquo;being installed,&rdquo; or some similar and areas that seemed open turned out to be undergoing reorganization or some similar activity.</p>

<p>Worse, there were no indications that this was going on from the front or from the reception desk. Browsing the web site in retrospect indicates that next Friday some significant exhibits are closing for replacement with new exhibits so maybe I just visited at precisely the wrong time, but an indication that I was visiting at a sub-optimal time would have been nice, both at the museum and on the web.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been using my backup Mac Powerbook (now a 5 year old vintage) as my primary these past two weeks ever since fsck spasmed out on a bad node conflict on my primary Mac Powerbook (my 3rd computer is a cheap Dell Desktop that runs a non-networked Windows XP for my daughter&rsquo;s games).</p>

<p>I never realized how much the Mac Powerbooks did speed up in 3 years, but I also saw at the Short Pump (Richmond VA, USA) Apple Store how much faster the Intel one are than mine. I went to the Apple Store so that I could confirm that I had only a software problem on my computer. I was afraid that maybe the hard drive was fast approaching failure.</p>

<p>The techs there confirmed that it was not failing and now I am watching it rebuild itself. This will be a multi-day process since I use DarwinPorts and will take the opportunity to test that not too much is broken in a new install of Gnome from Darwinports.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I broke Gnome and did not see it happening until later. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>The Gnome desktop is currently broken for new installs. The big breaker is Nautilus (port version = 2.12.x), which depends on some library (I&rsquo;m not sure which) being version 2.12.x, when that library is currently at 2.14.x. Nautilus 2.14.x, however, requires gnome-vfs to be version 2.14.x (see below).</p>

<p>This whole sorry mess stems from problems I am having getting the gnome-vfs package to version 2.14.1 (current). I am really hoping that I get it working (if somewhat crippled) before 2.14.2, which promises to fix these problems, is released.</p>

<p>I am aware that some Intel users and some Mac OS X 10.3.x users are reporting problems building the Gnome ports. I think I have a fix for the 10.3.x users but have to find the time to completely implement it (it seems that the linker is sometimes not seeing the X11R6 libraries).</p>

<p>A project to clean the dependency structures of the Gnome ports is about 2/3rds done. This project mostly involves figuring out which dependencies are also dependencies of a dependency and then paying close attention to the bug reports to determine what I should not have yanked out.</p>

<p>New release of Gstreamer (and its plugin ports) is being build tested. A question: does anyone have a known working test case for gstreamer that I can use?</p>

<p>I also have a (mostly) working tool that kind of automates the upgrade process for a port in the Gnome tree. I&rsquo;ll release it as soon as I 1) kill the bug in it that has sometimes causes it to write a Portfile without checksums and 2) get it to allow me to specify a port version on the command line to build.</p>

<p>I am trying to be more proactive about finding and fixing problems before they occur but also have to admit that I am not a programmer and have no formal training in any programming languages or tools other than Borland&rsquo;s Turbo Pascal on DOS about 12 years ago in high school. I am going to try keep the build problems I am seeing well-aired on the gnome-darwinports mailing list&mdash;if you can help me duplicate or fix problems, please subscribe to that list.</p>

<p>Hey thanks a lot!  I&rsquo;m using fink;  any advantages to using darwinports?  I&rsquo;m so glad I recently discovered about how to run gnome on OSX, now I don&rsquo;t even need my Ubuntu partition.  Are there any essential files you recommend I should get?  Also, how do I edit the menu at the top, and say, add icons for programs I&rsquo;ve downloaded (such as gimp)&hellip; Ubuntu has &ldquo;alacarte&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t see any way to do it in this port of gnome.</p></blockquote>

<p>I use Darwinports because I understand it. I moved from Fink to DarwinPorts when I wanted to port a piece of software (I now forget what) that required a more recent version of Gnome than Fink supported at the time (and apparently still supports). BTW, I have become the principal maintainer of Gnome for DarwinPorts.</p>

<p>DarwinPorts is working hard to remain current with Gnome, while Fink&rsquo;s installation is more stable, though dated. The downside to DarwinPorts is that every port must be built on your local machine while Fink provides ready-to-run binaries of its ports.</p>

<p>We do not have a working menu editor, but once most ports are installed, gnome-panel can be relaunched and the new port will simply appear. Note that some ports need to be built with a +gnome option in DarwinPorts for Gnome to be aware of them.</p>

<p>I stumbled onto your site and noticed you&rsquo;re running Gnome within the Mac&rsquo;s X11.  I do the same and was wondering if I could actually replace Aqua with gnome completely.  Is there a way to do that??  Thanks Randall.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>AFAIK Aqua can not be completely replaced by Gnome on Mac OS X 10.4. I know it could be on 10.3, but that on 10.4, the boot/login process (I forget if it was one or the other or both) required that Aqua be running.</p>

<p>You can however, use Metacity as the window manager and use X11 in full screen mode. A key combo would allow you to switch back and forth between X11 and Aqua in that case. This is how I run Gnome on 1 of my laptops. Many things are missing from the complete Gnome installation&mdash;they simply have not been successfully ported into Mac OS X yet, so you will have to drop back into Aqua to complete various tasks.</p>

<p>If you use Gnome from DarwinPorts, see <a href="http://wiki.opendarwin.org/index.php/DarwinPorts:Gnome">http://wiki.opendarwin.org/index.php/DarwinPorts:Gnome</a> for details. Running Gnome from Fink should be fairly similar.</p>

<p>I happen to use the DarwinPorts packages for my Gnome.</p>

<p>It was a yellow one with a large wingspan, and it bounced off the windshield, leaving some goo behind. I looked back for some other reason and there it was about 25 feet off the road flapping madly and spinning rapidly towards the road.</p>

<p>We must of thrown it at least 40 feet into the air.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Successfully upgraded glib and gtk to the GNOME 2.14.0 speced versions, albeit running GNOME 2.12.3 speced everything else.</p>

<p>The upgrade process was not as smooth as it should of/could of been:</p>

<p>Had to deactivte librsvg since that port is having some troubles with the new glib/gtk, causing the gdk-pixbuf.loaders file to not be built. I don&rsquo;t know anymore than that at the moment.</p>

<p>After installing the new gtk, I had to run the following:</p>

<pre><code>Getafix:/opt/local/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/loaders rhwood$ sudo -s
Getafix:/opt/local/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/loaders root# gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders *.so &gt; /opt/local/etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders
</code></pre>

<p>Next step is to build and test the orbit2, libbonobo, and gconf ports.</p>
