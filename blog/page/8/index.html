  <div class="entry-content"><p>My <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>-based installation of <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> is broken. It seems that when I installed KDE Office to verify that some GNOME packages that KDE Office uses were not breaking KDE Office once patched in MacPorts and then uninstalled KDE Office, that at-spi just broke.</p>

<p>Plus I am suffering some scrollkeeper/docbook build wierdness that is slowing the migration to GNOME 2.18 in MacPorts&hellip;</p>

<p>So anyway, I am axing my GNOME installation and my MacPorts installation and starting over from scratch this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> bug reporting tool, <strong>Bug Buddy</strong> works well. Maybe even too well.</p>

<p>I submitted a crash report to GNOME that had been submitted by a user to the <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> bug database that I could not figure out. <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419939">My bug report</a> was quickly closed, marked as a duplicate of <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=411791">another bug</a>.</p>

<p>You can see from the bug reports that this bug is a bug that should be handled by the distributors (MacPorts) of the software, not the developers. Unfortunately, I can find no sign that the bug reporter ever attempted to discuss the problem with the distributors.</p>

<p>So bug-buddy works and works well to gather bug reports and to (hopefully) improve the software, but it also means that the software distributor may never see a bug that it could easily fix by changing the linking flags for that bug.</p>

<p>Ah well, at least someone was able to point me to this report so that I could act on it&hellip;</p>

It actually took only a few hours work, and a day&rsquo;s waiting on compilers to get done.</p>

<p>I hope that getting the GNOME desktop into MacPorts is as painless as well.</p>

<p>](<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/randall.h.wood/LittleBlackBridge">http://picasaweb.google.com/randall.h.wood/LittleBlackBridge</a>)</p>

<p>Today I made a bridge for my daughter Augusta&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.brio.net">Brio Train</a>. It took about 90 minutes including finding the right box in the recycling bin and drying time.</p>

<p>The bridge is made from a small thin paperboard box that is was a little wider than the Brio tracks on its wide side, slightly shorter than the mid-length (about 6 inches) Brio straight track, and blackened with a large <a href="http://www.sharpie.com/sanford/consumer/sharpie/productcatalog/tipfamilydetail.jhtml?attributeId=SNATT_SUP_952003&amp;currentType=SNTYPE004">Sharpie marker</a>, then glued and cut to fit.</p>

<p>The ends of the box are folded back to make the openning of the bridge the width of the track and to give me space to glue the wings that hold the sides of the bridge upright. The wings are cut from the paperboard insert to some other box also in the bin.</p>

<p>Last week Augusta and I had made the paper stream that the bridge is sitting on (they are not attached together). The pictures were all taken soon after I finished the bridge, but while Augusta was at a friends house.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I know, I know. This seems more like a quarterly report than a weekly report, but it is more that I took a sabbatical from port maintenance than that I have been lazy with this report.</p>

<p>Almost all of the ported <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> packages are now at current stable versions! The big blocker on this was (and remains) <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org">d-bus</a>. It builds correctly, the d-bus glib bindings build correctly, but d-bus does not work correctly. Try running the test suite (<strong>make check</strong>) after building it and you&rsquo;ll see the problem.</p>

<p>I am planning on reworking the TODOs section of the <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/projects/macports/wiki/GNOME">MacPorts GNOME</a> page such that it is up-to-date and every TODO is listed as a ticket in the tracker.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a sort of Weekly Report.</p>

<p>I have been having some issues trying to get py-gnome to build at version 2.16.0 and am working those with the upstream maintainers. I have also been working with dbus upstream maintainers on getting a working dbus for Mac OS X.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be doing much by way of working on MacPorts in the coming weeks, as my wife and I are expecting our second child next week and she will rightfully be keeping away from this project.</p>

<p>I have two pleas while I&rsquo;m away. Can someone please look at the <a href="http://fink.sf.net">Fink</a> port of Firefox 1.5.0.7 for X11 and get it ported into MacPorts? And can someone please begin working on getting those GNOME ports that are still at version 2.12.x up to version 2.16.x?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>GNOME has sound! (Actually ever since we ported gstreamer version 0.10.0+, GNOME has had working sound if the esd output was selected in the GNOME Preferences.) This weekend I ported gnome-audio. Although it has no dependencies, and nothing depends on it except the gnome-desktop-suite metaport, it does provide a default set of sounds for the GNOME desktop.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the GNOME desktop is now at the version 2.16.0 specifications, although there are a couple of ports, such as gnome-applets, that just refuse to upgrade from 2.12/2.14 versions. I&rsquo;m sure they can be made to at least build, but I haven&rsquo;t figured out how yet.</p>

<p>There a couple of <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/projects/macports/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;verbose=1&amp;keywords=%7EGNOME&amp;type=task&amp;order=priority">GNOME Tasks</a> that when completed, or possibly just partially completed, will improve the quality and maintainability of the GNOME ports. I am still adding tasks as I think of them and as I think of how to write them.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/macports/gnome.html">port status</a> table that lists all the ports in the GNOME desktop. If anyone wants to have a go at porting a package that is not ported, or at updating the outdated ports, please do so, <a href="https://svn.macosforge.org/projects/macports/newticket">file a ticket</a> with the port attached and assign it to <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#x72;&#x68;&#119;&#x6f;&#111;&#100;&#x40;&#x6d;&#97;&#99;&#x70;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#x73;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#x2e;">&#114;&#x68;&#x77;&#x6f;&#111;&#100;&#x40;&#109;&#x61;&#99;&#x70;&#111;&#x72;&#x74;&#x73;&#46;&#x6f;&#114;&#x67;&#46;</a> Please note that if a port is listed as Broken and the port can not be found, it means that I have started working on the port, but have not yet gotten it to build or run well enough to release it to the rest of the MacPorts community.</p>

<p>In military lingo, NSTR means Nothing Significant To Report and is a short-hand we use since we want to keep all communications over a tacticle radio (including computer-based communications) to under 15 seconds.</p>

<p>I copied a list of every port I had installed and then wiped out my installation and am reinstalling everything now, to ensure that everything is linked against the updated gettext port. I have the base GNOME installation installed, and two port fixes have come out of that, but no new improvements or upgrades have been done.</p>

<p>GNOME has released version 2.16.1, so I will be upgrading against packages in that list (or will be as soon as my base install is completed).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week I began porting the GNOME desktop to version 2.16.0</p>

<p>I have been mostly porting libraries, not applications, so until I get the entire set in sync, it is possible that some applications will either fail to build or crash until the entire set is in sync.</p>

<p>Port <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org">dbus</a> has been reverted back to version 0.61 from 0.92 since dbus-glib can not build until some fundamental fixes are in on the dbus 0.9x ports. I have filed bugs with the upstream maintainer against this.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe I would have more to report, but it seems that perhaps I should hold off until next week, by which time, I hope to be more comfortable with the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com/">Trac</a> ticket system that has replaced <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">Bugzilla</a> on the MacPorts project.</p>

<p>Many things aren&rsquo;t working on my system due to the ongoing recovery from upgrading the gettext port and accidentally ripping out the older versions of that library.</p>
