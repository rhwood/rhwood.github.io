  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some DarwinPorts happenings:</p>

<p><strong>gnome-keyring-manager</strong>
Added the gnome-keyring-manager package to the DarwinPorts ports collection, but have not got it to work. It sees the gnome-keyring-daemon, but can&rsquo;t talk to it. I hope this is not a broken dbus issue.</p>

<p><strong>dbus</strong>
Am experimenting with dbus 0.61 on Mac OS X with GNOME and DarwinPorts. I have no clue how I would go about making sure that the Mac OS X user does not wind up spamming his session with dbus daemons, since AFAIK OS X has no easy mechanism for foreign per-user-session daemons to be launched so that all applications can see them.</p>

<p>I am going through my monthly installation of the gnome meta-port on a clean machine. It is not going as smoothly as I had hoped. Need to learn how to really debug TCL.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weekend past I attended the wedding of my wife&rsquo;s step brother, one BrianÂ by name. Augusta, my daughter participated.</p>

<p>She was the flower girl. Now, at 22 months of age she was intolerably cute. &lsquo;Specially in a little dress, sniffing the Tulips she was holding, holding the hand of the 4 year-old ring bearer.</p>

<p>That said, the weekend was difficult. We drove <em>way</em> too much. Augusta was at first livid at the amount of time spent in the car, crying and maybe even throwing a tantrum everytime we got in. Then she became simply sullenly resigned to it. But she seems to have now learned that the car is not some strange torture but a means to get from one place to another, just so long as she understands what that other place or activity is.</p>

<p>Even so, being strapped down is no fun at all.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have finally overcome my fear of needles.</p>

<p>There are basically two ways to overcome a fear of needles (if you are, in fact, afraid of needles):</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Become a Heroin addict, which I don&rsquo;t recommend.</p></li>
<li><p>Train to be a paramedic or combat life saver.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I am now a combat life saver. During our training we are both stuck by our fellow trainees (the standard is that we are capable of applying an IV to a patient) and stick our fellow trainees a minimum of two (2) times. Once you can stick without fear, you can be stuck without fear.</p>

<p>The loss of the fear was almost magical.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m an enlisted soldier. It means that when I see an officer outdoors, I salute. It&rsquo;s a simple thing to do and rarely is screwed up or even really noticed by the officer or soldier&mdash;that is, I salute, he returns the salute, and we go on about our lives.</p>

<p>Yesterday while waiting for my wife to pick me up from my place of work, I did salute a Major who was walking with a civilian. As the major returned the salute and they passed, I heard the civilian (who obviously has worked with the Major for some time) say &ldquo;I wondered why he did that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It feels odd to work at a military installation where that question could be asked, but it also says something about the all-volunteer inactive-reserves powered military that the United States has. For all I know that Major got called up and returned to work one day in the military uniform, but has been working that facility for years as a civilian, or that the civilian with him was former military. I don&rsquo;t know, and should not care.</p>

<p>But it seemed odd none-the-less.</p>

Yesterday Judge Dee woke me by knocking things off the headboards at about 0300. It was a bit early, but she tends to do that when she wants her daily wet food (dry food is always available to her). So I got up and fed her. And its being so early, I went back to bed instead of just staying up as I sometimes do (as I did to write this). Not a half hour later she was doing it again, and not wanting her to wake Augusta, I got up again and went to sit on the couch and spend some time with Judge Dee.</p>

<p>So we are out on the couch and I am getting cold. When I stand to get a blanket, Judge Dee jumps and runs under the christmas tree. I sit down on the couch, wrap myself in the blanket and watch Judge Dee in the dark. Soon Judge Dee has slipped away and I have no clue where she is. So I go back to bed.</p>

<p>Where Judge Dee is sitting on my side looking at me as if I must be crazy to move her or go back to bed there. I don&rsquo;t want her to wake Augusta by walking across her, so I just gave Judge Dee a disgusted look and went to sleep on the couch. Reports from Chrysta indicate that Judge Dee went to sleep on her not soon after.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Darwinports released a new version of the port engine this week and it broke my scripts that maintain the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/gnome/darwinports.html">GNOME on Darwinports</a> page. For some damned reason, the developers decided that tab-delimiting was not working, and so I had to rewrite my scripts to tokenize a string instead of simply exploding it into an array. Grr. Well, anyway things all work now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://esite.sf.net">eSite</a> is a tool for handling static web content. It basically allows for complex looking sites and some simple scripting (to, say, generate an index or complex tables based on external data that change infrequently, but drastically enough that hand maintenance is a pain) before pushing the static content to a server. eSite requires <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> on the system it runs on.</p>

<p>I finally got eSite into CVS on Sourceforge, so others can play with it. That&rsquo;s the real news here.</p>

<p>eSite is used to generate the templates for this blog, and a couple of pages that track, in a semi-automated way, some other information as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently moved from Daegu, Korea to Charlottesville, Virginia, USA and then a month after that moved again within Charlottesville. A week or so after the second move, Chrysta and Augusta joined me in Charlottesville from Stuttgart, Germany.</p>

<p>Augusta was born while I was on a confidence course in BCT at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That evening my entire company was taken out to the sand pit to do some grass drills to celebrate her birth. I didn&rsquo;t get to see her until she was three weeks old. After that, I was shipped to a second training post and then sent to Korea for a yearlong dependents restricted tour.</p>

<p>Augusta and Chrysta moved during that time to stay with Chrysta&rsquo;s parents in Stuttgart.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>About two weeks ago, I suddenly lost CVS access to the <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org">Opendarwin.org</a> servers. SSH was simply refusing to work. I have now traced the problem to SSHPassKey, and have replaced it with manual work and maybe SSH Agent (A Mac OS X GUI for ssh-agent).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>GNOME on Darwinports is something of a mess since the upgrade from GNOME 2.10 to 2.12. Things are just breaking all over the place. And what does not break at build time is liable to break at run time. Part of me is inclined to say that this indicates that DarwinPorts dependencies should be satisfied by requiring that the darwinports version of the required library be the version that is used.</p>

<p>In any event, just wanting a working up-to-date GNOME installation has got me
1. Requesting an account on OpenDarwin.org&rsquo;s CVS servers so that I can get updated portfiles in faster,
2. Subscribing to some GNOME mailing lists, which unfortunately, are either too noisy or too quiet,
3. Getting Bugzilla accounts at <a href="http://freedesktop.org">FreeDesktop.org</a>, <a href="http://gnome.org">GNOME.org</a>, and <a href="http://abisource.org">AbiSource.org</a>.
4. Wondering what can be done to get more GNOME developers working on making sure all of their work runs on an Apple platform.
5. Wondering if maybe life would simply be more pleasant if I paid the $30 for iBlog instead of insisting on using free software.</p>
