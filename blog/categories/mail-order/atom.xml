    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Late Friday afternoon, I purchased three software products from <a href="http://store.apple.com">Apple</a> online. I price shopped <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> as well, but Amazon.com was unable to satisfactorily compute my shipping or tax burdens (the software I wanted to purchase would have shipped from two different firms: Amazon.com and JR Music and Video or some such operation). The quoted Amazon price, including shipping, and vague on taxes, was only about 8 dollars less expensive than the total Apple price, but Apple was certain about my tax burden and providing free shipping, so I went with Apple.</p>
