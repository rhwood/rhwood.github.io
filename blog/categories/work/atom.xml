    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just upgraded my laptop at work to Fedora 9, and I really like the new package manager, but otherwise am ambivalent about the upgrade. I recommend that upgraders wait a couple of weeks for some bugs to get ironed out first.</p>

<p>X just would not work at first&mdash;I had to use system-display-manager or system-display-configure (I&rsquo;m at home on my Mac) to correct the display drivers before that would work, and other services were breaking until I updated the system with the latest online only packages are restarted everything a couple of times.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I need to run a virtual machine on my <a href="/blog/2008/03/08/my-laptop-at-work/">work computer</a> that provides <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP">DHCP</a> services on a host-only network. Unfortunately, <a href="http://vmware.com/products/server/">VMWare Server</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> does not provide any mechanism for turning its DHCP services off.</p>

<p>Luckily, I found an <a href="http://vmwire.blogspot.com/2008/01/how-to-disable-host-only-networking.html">article</a> that addresses turning DHCP on or off for all host-only networks on the VMWare Server. I commented on that article with a technique for controlling DHCP on a per-network basis for host-only networks. I since have expanded on that with a patch for <em>/usr/lib/vmware/net-services.sh</em> that further refines the controls:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently began working at <a href="http://www.trustedcs.com">Trusted Computer Solutions</a> (TCS). TCS is (as I understand things) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> shop transitioning from a being a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp">Solaris</a> shop.</p>

<p>But we run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows</a> on most of our desktop computers.</p>

<p>I received permission to install <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> on my Laptop as my primary operating system, and quickly set about doing so. So far I have only two significant problems with the computer:
1. <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare Server</a> is slow when running our Linux systems. I think that we have stripped the OS down to a basic system for our purposes, so its not liking running in the virtual machine.
2. There is a whole infrastructure in place to support Windows users that is not well documented. (It just works in Windows, but not Linux.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The night before last, Friday morning at about 0100 hours actually, I went to the emergency room with chest pains. While it turns out that it was not a heart failure or problem, my doctor is not sure what caused the pains.</p>

<p>At the time, I had been suffering from intense diarrhea for a few days, and was somewhat dehydrated. They pumped about 2.5 liters of IV into me during my early morning visit to the ER.</p>

<p>My doctor does allow for the possibility that simple stress could have caused the pains, but he can only really diagnose stress by negative elimination&hellip;</p>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;m recovering rapidly now, but will have to learn how to vent stress in less harmful ways.</p>
