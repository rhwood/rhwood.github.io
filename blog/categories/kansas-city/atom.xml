<p><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/randall.h.wood/KansasCity2007">Trip Photos</a>
This month, we took a family vacation to Kansas City to visit my father-in-law, Hutch, his youngest son, Sam, and his mother-in-law, Kim (Dea, his wife passed away from Cancer a few years ago). We travelled by train, with layovers in Washington and Chicago. There were many photo opportunities, but for the most part, we failed to use the camera by:</p>

<ol>
<li> Forgetting that we had it. There were a couple of days that had we not left the camera at Hutch&rsquo;s, we could have taken a number of photos to send to grandparents and the like.</li>
<li> Bringing the small flash card. We have two flash cards: the 32MB card that came with the camera and a 512MB card that we bought later. Guess which one travelled with us. This meant that on those days that we did have the camera with us, it generally ran out of memory.</li>
<li> Not really knowing how to use it. Both Chrysta and I managed to take a number of pictures that are not focused, probably because we are not experienced enough with the camera.
The <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/randall.h.wood/KansasCity2007">photo album</a> is not yet complete, and I will be writing more about the trip in detail later.</li>
</ol>

<p>Way back when in late 2003, Kathy, my mother-in-law, bought us a digital camera so that we could send her pictures of her grandchild, due to be born in April 2004. We took the camera on a trip to visit Chrysta&rsquo;s father in December 2003 in Kansas City. I think that all of 6 photos survive from that trip. They are on the memory card that came with the camera, which we found recently. It is a 32MB card (we use a 512MB one now). There are a couple of pictures from Alexandria from about that time as well a set of very recent (as in last week) photos of our girls.</p>

<p>That the photos that survive from that trip, with the exception of a single photo of Sam, are from Chicago where we had a layover or from the train on that same day is indicitive of our <strong>habit</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>habit</em> is the habit of forgetting that we have the (or a) camera. I like to say that I am too busy living life to document it, but sometimes wonder if I am simply justifying the <em>habit</em>. I do know that Denis (my father) taught both explicitly and by example that I was not to honor others attempts to document their lives with video by not worrying about walking between him and his subject, but was to honor the still photographer&rsquo;s attempts to take a photo by not walking in between him and his subject. I also hate posing for photographs and prefer photographs that depict people just living. Chrysta just does not like being photographed&hellip;</p>

<p>BTW, the photo album is so named simply because the memory stick has sat in a drawer for a while.</p>
