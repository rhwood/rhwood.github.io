<p>Way back when in late 2003, Kathy, my mother-in-law, bought us a digital camera so that we could send her pictures of her grandchild, due to be born in April 2004. We took the camera on a trip to visit Chrysta&rsquo;s father in December 2003 in Kansas City. I think that all of 6 photos survive from that trip. They are on the memory card that came with the camera, which we found recently. It is a 32MB card (we use a 512MB one now). There are a couple of pictures from Alexandria from about that time as well a set of very recent (as in last week) photos of our girls.</p>

<p>That the photos that survive from that trip, with the exception of a single photo of Sam, are from Chicago where we had a layover or from the train on that same day is indicitive of our <strong>habit</strong>.</p>

<p>The <em>habit</em> is the habit of forgetting that we have the (or a) camera. I like to say that I am too busy living life to document it, but sometimes wonder if I am simply justifying the <em>habit</em>. I do know that Denis (my father) taught both explicitly and by example that I was not to honor others attempts to document their lives with video by not worrying about walking between him and his subject, but was to honor the still photographer&rsquo;s attempts to take a photo by not walking in between him and his subject. I also hate posing for photographs and prefer photographs that depict people just living. Chrysta just does not like being photographed&hellip;</p>

<p>BTW, the photo album is so named simply because the memory stick has sat in a drawer for a while.</p>
