    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A brief note on the status of <em>Pallet</em> and the <em>MacPorts.Framework</em>:</p>

<h1>Pallet</h1>

<p><em>Pallet</em> continues to have some user-interface weirdness that I have not really figured out (nor have I spent much time trying to figure it out either) and is dependent on getting the <em>MacPorts.Framework</em> completed</p>

<h1>MacPorts.Framework</h1>

<p>The framework has one two major issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>It needs to be capable of posting asynchronous notifications from the Tcl Framework to the Objective-C classes that are wrapping the Tcl code. I have found some reference code that may help me write an implementation, but have not begun doing so.</li>
<li>I am now thinking that I might need to write a MacPorts Application Kit Framework that would provide applications (which should run their user interfaces as the console user, not as root) an API that calls an authenticated helper for certain tasks. This may further push back Pallet development.</li>
</ol>


<p>I have just moved and am starting a new job next week, so I will probably not be picking these tasks up quickly, but if anyone wants to work these issues or projects with me, drop a line.</p>

Here is the obligatory screen shot of Pallet.</p>

<p>Note some features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Live search bar searching categories, names, and descriptions</li>
<li>Maintainers and dependencies are listed as tokens (although there is no way to take advantage of that right now)</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pallet is the beginnings of an attempt to write a usable and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> for the <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> software porting system.</p>

<p>Pallet uses its own parser for the port indexes on your system, so it loads the ports list fast, but beyond that is not much help right now.</p>

<p>It builds and runs only on Mac OS X 10.4.x. I am using some Cocoa features that are not available on earlier versions of Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Right now the best way to get it is to install a working MacPorts system and then sudo port install pallet</p>
