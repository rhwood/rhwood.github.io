    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday morning I upgraded my work laptop from Fedora 9 to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora">Fedora 10</a>. Other than a couple of issues outlined below, the experience seemed reasonable:</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>The bootloader (grub) did not upgrade correctly, leaving me at a grub prompt when the computer started. Apparently this is a common issue. The fix was simple in my case:

<ol>
<li><code>root (hd0,1)</code></li>
<li><code>setup (hd0,1)</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMware Workstation</a> refused to heal from the upgrade. Usually VMware Workstation just heals itself after I update the kernel, but for some reason it refused to heal itself. Again a simple fix:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>rm /usr/lib/vmware/modules/binary</code></li>
<li><code>vmware modconfig --console --install-all</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Immediately after installing Fedora (on only the second day after its release) there were a ridiculous number of updates to be downloaded, so I basically the first thing I did with the system was let it download and install updates for three hours.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> on my iMac to download <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> so I could install it on my work computer and on an older PowerBook I have. I have been serving it up for the last 36 hours or so as well. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot: <a href="http://shyramblings.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/transmission1.png"><img src="http://shyramblings.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/transmission1.png?w=300" alt="" /></a>
At least I pushed out more data than I consumed. Its a minor contribution, but  a contribution none-the-less.
I will probably stop the push when Mac OS X 10.5.3 finishes downloading and requires me to restart the iMac, as this will allow me to bring the machine down at night to save power, and to aggressively use other power saving features and timeouts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just upgraded my laptop at work to Fedora 9, and I really like the new package manager, but otherwise am ambivalent about the upgrade. I recommend that upgraders wait a couple of weeks for some bugs to get ironed out first.</p>

<p>X just would not work at first&mdash;I had to use system-display-manager or system-display-configure (I&rsquo;m at home on my Mac) to correct the display drivers before that would work, and other services were breaking until I updated the system with the latest online only packages are restarted everything a couple of times.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently began working at <a href="http://www.trustedcs.com">Trusted Computer Solutions</a> (TCS). TCS is (as I understand things) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> shop transitioning from a being a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp">Solaris</a> shop.</p>

<p>But we run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows</a> on most of our desktop computers.</p>

<p>I received permission to install <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> on my Laptop as my primary operating system, and quickly set about doing so. So far I have only two significant problems with the computer:
1. <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare Server</a> is slow when running our Linux systems. I think that we have stripped the OS down to a basic system for our purposes, so its not liking running in the virtual machine.
2. There is a whole infrastructure in place to support Windows users that is not well documented. (It just works in Windows, but not Linux.)</p>
