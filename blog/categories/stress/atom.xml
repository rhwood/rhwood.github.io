    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The night before last, Friday morning at about 0100 hours actually, I went to the emergency room with chest pains. While it turns out that it was not a heart failure or problem, my doctor is not sure what caused the pains.</p>

<p>At the time, I had been suffering from intense diarrhea for a few days, and was somewhat dehydrated. They pumped about 2.5 liters of IV into me during my early morning visit to the ER.</p>

<p>My doctor does allow for the possibility that simple stress could have caused the pains, but he can only really diagnose stress by negative elimination&hellip;</p>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;m recovering rapidly now, but will have to learn how to vent stress in less harmful ways.</p>
