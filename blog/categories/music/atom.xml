    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I remember one summer at home&mdash;I think it was the summer of &lsquo;98&mdash;when a single lonely saxophone would play out over the roofs of the neighborhood in the evenings. It was one of the insanely beautiful moments that made Raleigh seem at so much more urbane and cosmopolitan than it seemed during the day.</p>

<p>In any event, yesterday was the first day of spring when doors and windows were flung open and people just stayed outdoors. Usually the music of balmy afternoons in my neighborhood is of a Mexican or Salvadorian flavor, and occasionally jazz or even classical music. Unfortunately this time it was abrasive sensationalist Hip-hop of the most banal and vulgar kind.</p>

<p>Somehow I managed to shutout the lyrics and think of that saxophone until the language was brought to my attention, and it kind of put a damper on the afternoon.</p>

It&rsquo;s not my first iTunes purchase, but it&rsquo;s my first in a long time. I also spent a few hours simply feeding CDs to my computer to add to my iTunes library.
