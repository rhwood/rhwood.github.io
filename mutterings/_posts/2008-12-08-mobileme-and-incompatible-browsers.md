I had gotten used to using my [iDisk](http://idisk.me.com/) to hold personal stuff that I need when I&rsquo;m at drills, but was surprised to see the following when attempting to get to it: [![](http://shyramblings.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/me-on-ie.png?w=300)](http://shyramblings.files.wordpress.com/2008/12/me-on-ie.png)

While it turns out that I can read the iDisk with [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/ie), I did have to consult [Apple's](http://www.apple.com/) [support site](http://www.apple.com/support/mobileme/) to do so. Luckly, Apple is not so picky about how you can access that. Unfortunately, [Firefox](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=118911&amp;t=45) does not yet seem to be widely available on [DoD](http://www.defenselink.mil/) computers on the [NIPRNET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIPRNET) yet, or I never would have noticed.
