I used to be totally flexible in my life. It (my live, my future) was wide open, on some arid plains somewhere, full of beauty and possibility.

Now it feels like my life is in Brazil&ndash;the movie, not the country&ndash;stuck in long corridors, filled with locked doors. My fear of taking any risks with my life, my kid&rsquo;s lives, and Chrysta&rsquo;s life, is the lock which bars me from opening any of these doors.

I feel that even posting this message is attacking that fear, and can only hope that this gives me the strength to push farther and harder (without, of course, taking excessive risks).
