About two weeks ago, I suddenly lost CVS access to the [Opendarwin.org](http://www.opendarwin.org) servers. SSH was simply refusing to work. I have now traced the problem to SSHPassKey, and have replaced it with manual work and maybe SSH Agent (A Mac OS X GUI for ssh-agent).

(I&rsquo;m too lazy right now to look up the URLs.)
