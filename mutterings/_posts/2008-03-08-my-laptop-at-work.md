I recently began working at [Trusted Computer Solutions](http://www.trustedcs.com) (TCS). TCS is (as I understand things) a [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) shop transitioning from a being a [Solaris](http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp) shop.

But we run [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows) on most of our desktop computers.

I received permission to install [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org) on my Laptop as my primary operating system, and quickly set about doing so. So far I have only two significant problems with the computer:
1. [VMWare Server](http://www.vmware.com) is slow when running our Linux systems. I think that we have stripped the OS down to a basic system for our purposes, so its not liking running in the virtual machine.
2. There is a whole infrastructure in place to support Windows users that is not well documented. (It just works in Windows, but not Linux.)
