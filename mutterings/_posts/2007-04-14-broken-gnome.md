My [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org)-based installation of [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) is broken. It seems that when I installed KDE Office to verify that some GNOME packages that KDE Office uses were not breaking KDE Office once patched in MacPorts and then uninstalled KDE Office, that at-spi just broke.

Plus I am suffering some scrollkeeper/docbook build wierdness that is slowing the migration to GNOME 2.18 in MacPorts&hellip;

So anyway, I am axing my GNOME installation and my MacPorts installation and starting over from scratch this weekend.
