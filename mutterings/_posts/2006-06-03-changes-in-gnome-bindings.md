My auto-status tool for the GNOME packages in DarwinPorts broke because GNOME&rsquo;s MD5 hashsum list for the official packages for 2.14.2 are different than for prior releases. Until I handle the change in my tool, the reporting is going to indicate that many of the binding packages are either broken or not ported at all when they do, in fact, work perfectly well.

Grr.
