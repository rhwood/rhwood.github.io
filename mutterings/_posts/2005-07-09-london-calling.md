Could not call my wife in Germany from Korea the night-for-me/morning-for-her when London was bombed. Korean Telecoms simply reported that the call could not be completed without even hitting the international circuits.

Had to keep track of what was going down for work as well. My section is responsible for tracking outside events that may effect my organization&rsquo;s activities. So far, the bombings have had no effect on operations.

Pulled out my London Calling LP and played it loud.
