The [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) bug reporting tool, __Bug Buddy__ works well. Maybe even too well.

I submitted a crash report to GNOME that had been submitted by a user to the [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) bug database that I could not figure out. [My bug report](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419939) was quickly closed, marked as a duplicate of [another bug](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=411791).

You can see from the bug reports that this bug is a bug that should be handled by the distributors (MacPorts) of the software, not the developers. Unfortunately, I can find no sign that the bug reporter ever attempted to discuss the problem with the distributors.

So bug-buddy works and works well to gather bug reports and to (hopefully) improve the software, but it also means that the software distributor may never see a bug that it could easily fix by changing the linking flags for that bug.

Ah well, at least someone was able to point me to this report so that I could act on it&hellip;
