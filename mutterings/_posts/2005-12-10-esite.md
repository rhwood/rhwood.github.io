[eSite](http://esite.sf.net) is a tool for handling static web content. It basically allows for complex looking sites and some simple scripting (to, say, generate an index or complex tables based on external data that change infrequently, but drastically enough that hand maintenance is a pain) before pushing the static content to a server. eSite requires [PHP](http://www.php.net) on the system it runs on.

I finally got eSite into CVS on Sourceforge, so others can play with it. That&rsquo;s the real news here.

eSite is used to generate the templates for this blog, and a couple of pages that track, in a semi-automated way, some other information as well.
