A few of the core [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) packages carried by [DarwinPorts](https://macports.org) have been updated over the week. Most of my patches have been accepted and applied, but some have yet to trickle into my PortIndex. View the [status tables](https://trac.macports.org/wiki/GNOMEPackageStatus).
