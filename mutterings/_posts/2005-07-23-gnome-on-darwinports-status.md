A few of the core [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org) packages carried by [DarwinPorts](http://darwinports.opendarwin.org) have been updated over the week. Most of my patches have been accepted and applied, but some have yet to trickle into my PortIndex. View the [status tables](http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/gnome/darwinports.html).
