Last month, I created a [Google Custom Search](http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=011837386708472035020:5lqtx6zp3qw) of the [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) websites: the project home, the  guide, the wiki, the tickets database, and the source code browser.

I had suggested using it within the MacPorts sites to the project managers, but have not heard any response one way or other, so here it is.
