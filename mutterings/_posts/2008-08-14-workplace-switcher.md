Why does the commercial application display its icon in the GNOME Workspace Switcher (even though it is not full screen), but the open source applications don&rsquo;t?

The applications open in the Switcher are from left-to-right:

* Evolution (a GNOME project)
* VMWare Workstation
* Yelp (a GNOME project)
* Firefox
