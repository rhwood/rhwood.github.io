Yesterday I rode a little more than 20 miles on the [Washington &amp; Old Dominion trail](https://www.novaparks.com/parks/washington-and-old-dominion-railroad-regional-park). Isabella rode with me, and apparently slept most of the trip. This was my first 20 mile cycle ride in I-don&rsquo;t-know-how-long, at least 5 years, and much to my surprise, despite my not having warmed up before hand, I&rsquo;m not sore as a result.
