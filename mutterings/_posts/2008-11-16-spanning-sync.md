_**Update:** As of June 2013, Spanning Sync was overcome by events (changes in OS X and Google made it obsolete) and the developer ceased supporting it._

I use [Spanning Sync](http://spanningsync.com/?r=8KYFFP) to synchronize the address book and calendars on my Macs with my [Google accounts](http://www.google.com/accounts) (yes, that's plural - I have one Google account, and one account at a [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/) site). It has been working great, allowing me to use my [iMac](http://www.apple.com/imac) as the central hub by which everything else just stays in sync.

However, it is not free software, and being a heavy user of GNOME and other open source software projects, I spent some time shopping around for a free solution that performed as well as this, as easily as this, and just failed to find one. It's the first software purchase that I have made other than Mac OS X in a long time, and I think its been worth it.

Spanning Sync recently (a few months ago actually) began encouraging users to advertise the software by offering a discount to both the referred-to user and the referring user.
