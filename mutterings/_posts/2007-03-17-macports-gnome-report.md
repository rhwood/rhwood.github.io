I managed to, within 3 days of [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org) releasing version [2.18.0](https://www.gnome.org/start/2.18), get the entire current GNOME Platform into [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org). It actually took only a few hours work, and a day&rsquo;s waiting on compilers to get done.

I hope that getting the GNOME desktop into MacPorts is as painless as well.
