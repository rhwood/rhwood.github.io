<p>I have been using the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/izero">Inbox 0</a> system to manage my email at work for a couple of months. It&rsquo;s working out mostly, as I find that I sometimes let my Inbox grow again before cleaning it up, and I still have not gone completely though the DMZ folder to determine what needs to be archived and what doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Prior to using Inbox 0 to manage the inbox, I had been using search filters to control my email, but still found that it wasn&rsquo;t working to well. When I received I forget what version of Mac OS X with really good search engines in the email, and then later got a <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> account, I began to use search folders, and it worked for a while, until the sheer volume of email overwhelmed it.</p>

<p>Also this never worked at work, since neither <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/outlook">Outlook</a> (2003) nor <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evolution/">Evolution</a> seem to be good at filtering email or searching through inboxes, in my experience.</p>
