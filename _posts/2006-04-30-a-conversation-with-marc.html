  <p>Hey thanks a lot!  I&rsquo;m using fink;  any advantages to using darwinports?  I&rsquo;m so glad I recently discovered about how to run gnome on OSX, now I don&rsquo;t even need my Ubuntu partition.  Are there any essential files you recommend I should get?  Also, how do I edit the menu at the top, and say, add icons for programs I&rsquo;ve downloaded (such as gimp)&hellip; Ubuntu has &ldquo;alacarte&rdquo;, but I don&rsquo;t see any way to do it in this port of gnome.</p>

<p>I use Darwinports because I understand it. I moved from Fink to DarwinPorts when I wanted to port a piece of software (I now forget what) that required a more recent version of Gnome than Fink supported at the time (and apparently still supports). BTW, I have become the principal maintainer of Gnome for DarwinPorts.</p>

<p>DarwinPorts is working hard to remain current with Gnome, while Fink&rsquo;s installation is more stable, though dated. The downside to DarwinPorts is that every port must be built on your local machine while Fink provides ready-to-run binaries of its ports.</p>

<p>We do not have a working menu editor, but once most ports are installed, gnome-panel can be relaunched and the new port will simply appear. Note that some ports need to be built with a +gnome option in DarwinPorts for Gnome to be aware of them.</p>

    <p>I stumbled onto your site and noticed you&rsquo;re running Gnome within the Mac&rsquo;s X11.  I do the same and was wondering if I could actually replace Aqua with gnome completely.  Is there a way to do that??  Thanks Randall.</p>

<p>AFAIK Aqua can not be completely replaced by Gnome on Mac OS X 10.4. I know it could be on 10.3, but that on 10.4, the boot/login process (I forget if it was one or the other or both) required that Aqua be running.</p>

<p>You can however, use Metacity as the window manager and use X11 in full screen mode. A key combo would allow you to switch back and forth between X11 and Aqua in that case. This is how I run Gnome on 1 of my laptops. Many things are missing from the complete Gnome installation&ndash;they simply have not been successfully ported into Mac OS X yet, so you will have to drop back into Aqua to complete various tasks.</p>

<p>If you use Gnome from DarwinPorts, see <a href="http://wiki.opendarwin.org/index.php/DarwinPorts:Gnome">http://wiki.opendarwin.org/index.php/DarwinPorts:Gnome</a> for details. Running Gnome from Fink should be fairly similar.</p>

<p>I happen to use the DarwinPorts packages for my Gnome.</p>
