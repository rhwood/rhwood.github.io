<p>Some DarwinPorts happenings:</p>

<p><strong>gnome-keyring-manager</strong>
Added the gnome-keyring-manager package to the DarwinPorts ports collection, but have not got it to work. It sees the gnome-keyring-daemon, but can&rsquo;t talk to it. I hope this is not a broken dbus issue.</p>

<p><strong>dbus</strong>
Am experimenting with dbus 0.61 on Mac OS X with GNOME and DarwinPorts. I have no clue how I would go about making sure that the Mac OS X user does not wind up spamming his session with dbus daemons, since AFAIK OS X has no easy mechanism for foreign per-user-session daemons to be launched so that all applications can see them.</p>

<p>I am going through my monthly installation of the gnome meta-port on a clean machine. It is not going as smoothly as I had hoped. Need to learn how to really debug TCL.</p>
