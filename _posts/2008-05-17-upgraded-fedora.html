<p>I just upgraded my laptop at work to Fedora 9, and I really like the new package manager, but otherwise am ambivalent about the upgrade. I recommend that upgraders wait a couple of weeks for some bugs to get ironed out first.</p>

<p>X just would not work at first&ndash;I had to use system-display-manager or system-display-configure (I&rsquo;m at home on my Mac) to correct the display drivers before that would work, and other services were breaking until I updated the system with the latest online only packages are restarted everything a couple of times.</p>
