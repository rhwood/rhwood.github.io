<p>A few of the core <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> packages carried by <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org">DarwinPorts</a> have been updated over the week. Most of my patches have been accepted and applied, but some have yet to trickle into my PortIndex. View the <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/gnome/darwinports.html">status tables</a>.</p>
