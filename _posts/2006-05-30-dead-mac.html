<p>My Powerbook&rsquo;s hard drive, not three days after a complete checkup at the Short Pump Genuis Bar just failed. At the hardware level no less.</p>

<p>I had basically just finished rebuilding the OS on it since all the testing tools agreed that we had a software problem with the drive. Oh well&hellip;</p>
