<p>Recently when Chrysta and I were driving in the country&ndash;one of the rare occasions when I was a passenger&ndash;we hit a butterfly on our windshield.</p>

<p>It was a yellow one with a large wingspan, and it bounced off the windshield, leaving some goo behind. I looked back for some other reason and there it was about 25 feet off the road flapping madly and spinning rapidly towards the road.</p>

<p>We must of thrown it at least 40 feet into the air.</p>

<p>It was a moment of sadness.</p>
