<p>Yesterday Augusta, my 2 year old daughter, climbed onto a bunk bed that is in her room (we got it used knowing that soon we will need the bunking capability) while we were not in the room, and then tried to get down by swinging off the side of the upper bed and lowering herself to the floor.</p>

<p>Only she is a bit small for that.</p>

<p>She screamed while hanging onto the bed and Chrysta and I rushed to her room, and once Chrysta had put her on the floor and was almost hysterical and admonishing her, Augusta just kept on saying &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
