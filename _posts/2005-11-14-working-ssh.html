<p>About two weeks ago, I suddenly lost CVS access to the <a href="http://www.opendarwin.org">Opendarwin.org</a> servers. SSH was simply refusing to work. I have now traced the problem to SSHPassKey, and have replaced it with manual work and maybe SSH Agent (A Mac OS X GUI for ssh-agent).</p>

<p>(I&rsquo;m too lazy right now to look up the URLs.)</p>
