<p>The <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> bug reporting tool, <strong>Bug Buddy</strong> works well. Maybe even too well.</p>

<p>I submitted a crash report to GNOME that had been submitted by a user to the <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> bug database that I could not figure out. <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419939">My bug report</a> was quickly closed, marked as a duplicate of <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=411791">another bug</a>.</p>

<p>You can see from the bug reports that this bug is a bug that should be handled by the distributors (MacPorts) of the software, not the developers. Unfortunately, I can find no sign that the bug reporter ever attempted to discuss the problem with the distributors.</p>

<p>So bug-buddy works and works well to gather bug reports and to (hopefully) improve the software, but it also means that the software distributor may never see a bug that it could easily fix by changing the linking flags for that bug.</p>

<p>Ah well, at least someone was able to point me to this report so that I could act on it&hellip;</p>
