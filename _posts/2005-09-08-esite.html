<p>I had been maintaining my site with a combination of online tools (<a href="http://Blogger.com">Blogger</a> mostly, <a href="http://www.mac.com">.Mac</a>, and a bunch of google searches), some tools I installed via <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org">Darwinports</a> (bluefish, drivel, and gedit), and a set of PHP, shell, and Makefile scripts that I built up over time.</p>

<p>Well, that is changing.</p>

<p>I have rewritten some of the scripts into a general purpose tool to maintain static  websites called <a href="http://esite.sourceforge.net">eSite</a>, as in &ldquo;easy site.&rdquo; The tool turned out to be a little more complex than expected and a little more flexible than expected and so I documented it and squated on a dead SourceForge project to share it with others.</p>

<p>The tool has replaced all but one script that I had used previously to maintain the sites. And it has generated a second site to maintain as well.</p>
