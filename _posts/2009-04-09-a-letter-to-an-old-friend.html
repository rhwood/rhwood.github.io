<p>I remember being very angry at what I felt was an unnecessarily self congratulatory tone of <i>Unzipped</i>, the movie about Isaac Mizrahi. I remember that you seemed somewhat shocked by that.<br/><br/>
I now know that I was wrong wrong wrong about that&ndash;celebrating one&rsquo;s life is, well, a celebration worth having; failing to celebrate one&rsquo;s life and one&rsquo;s feeling of accomplishment is a wrong thing to do.</p>
