<p>I have finally overcome my fear of needles.</p>

<p>There are basically two ways to overcome a fear of needles (if you are, in fact, afraid of needles):</p>

<ol><li><p>Become a Heroin addict, which I don&rsquo;t recommend.</p></li>
<li><p>Train to be a paramedic or combat life saver.</p></li>
</ol><p>I am now a combat life saver. During our training we are both stuck by our fellow trainees (the standard is that we are capable of applying an IV to a patient) and stick our fellow trainees a minimum of two (2) times. Once you can stick without fear, you can be stuck without fear.</p>

<p>The loss of the fear was almost magical.</p>
