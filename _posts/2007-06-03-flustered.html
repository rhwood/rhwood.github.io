<p>I get badly flustered when I am calling someone and their voicemail or answering machine picks up instead. I hope I&rsquo;m not the only person who has this problem. Sometimes I have to hang up and think about the message I want to leave before I call back to leave the message.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really annoying.</p>
