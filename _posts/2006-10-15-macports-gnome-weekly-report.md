<p>GNOME has sound! (Actually ever since we ported gstreamer version 0.10.0+, GNOME has had working sound if the esd output was selected in the GNOME Preferences.) This weekend I ported gnome-audio. Although it has no dependencies, and nothing depends on it except the gnome-desktop-suite metaport, it does provide a default set of sounds for the GNOME desktop.</p>

<p>A significant portion of the GNOME desktop is now at the version 2.16.0 specifications, although there are a couple of ports, such as gnome-applets, that just refuse to upgrade from 2.12/2.14 versions. I&rsquo;m sure they can be made to at least build, but I haven&rsquo;t figured out how yet.</p>

<p>There a couple of <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/projects/macports/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;verbose=1&amp;keywords=%7EGNOME&amp;type=task&amp;order=priority">GNOME Tasks</a> that when completed, or possibly just partially completed, will improve the quality and maintainability of the GNOME ports. I am still adding tasks as I think of them and as I think of how to write them.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/macports/gnome.html">port status</a> table that lists all the ports in the GNOME desktop. If anyone wants to have a go at porting a package that is not ported, or at updating the outdated ports, please do so, <a href="https://svn.macosforge.org/projects/macports/newticket">file a ticket</a> with the port attached and assign it to rhwood@macports.org. Please note that if a port is listed as Broken and the port can not be found, it means that I have started working on the port, but have not yet gotten it to build or run well enough to release it to the rest of the MacPorts community.</p>

<p>Report 4</p>
