Last month, I created a Google Custom Search of the [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) websites: the project home, the  guide, the wiki, the tickets database, and the source code browser.

I had suggested using it within the MacPorts sites to the project managers, but have not heard any response one way or other, so here it is.

Update 2025-11-01: At some point this year, Google broke the search link, and after 17 years of inattention (and MacPorts making their own search tools), I'm not going to try to fix it.
