<p>Successfully upgraded glib and gtk to the GNOME 2.14.0 speced versions, albeit running GNOME 2.12.3 speced everything else.</p>

<p>The upgrade process was not as smooth as it should of/could of been:</p>

<p>Had to deactivte librsvg since that port is having some troubles with the new glib/gtk, causing the gdk-pixbuf.loadersÂ file to not be built. I don&rsquo;t know anymore than that at the moment.</p>

<p>After installing the new gtk, I had to run the following:</p>

<pre><code>Getafix:/opt/local/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/loaders rhwood$ sudo -s
Getafix:/opt/local/lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/loaders root# gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders *.so &gt; /opt/local/etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders
</code></pre>

<p>Next step is to build and test the orbit2, libbonobo, and gconf ports.</p>
