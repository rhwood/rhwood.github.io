<p>This past week has been LOOONNNNGGGG.</p>

<p>Without going into details, (my employer is really paranoid about leaking that which should not be leaked), things started rough and only got rougher.</p>

<p>My desks at both home and work are absolute messes now.</p>

<p>I can only hope that things will not be so bad next week, but I&rsquo;m not really all that optimistic about it either&hellip;</p>
