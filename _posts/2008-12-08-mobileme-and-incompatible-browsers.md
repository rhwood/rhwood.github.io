I had gotten used to using my [iDisk](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive) to hold personal stuff that I need when I&rsquo;m at drills, but was surprised to see the following when attempting to get to it: [![](/assets/2008-12-08-me-on-ie.png){:width="300px"}](/assets/2008-12-08-me-on-ie.png)

While it turns out that I can read the iDisk with [Internet Explorer](https://www.microsoft.com/ie), I did have to consult [Apple's](https://www.apple.com/) [support site](https://web.archive.org/web/20080809095658/https://www.apple.com//support/mobileme/) to do so. Luckly, Apple is not so picky about how you can access that. Unfortunately, [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) does not yet seem to be widely available on [DoD](https://www.defense.gov) computers on the [NIPRNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIPRNET) yet, or I never would have noticed.
