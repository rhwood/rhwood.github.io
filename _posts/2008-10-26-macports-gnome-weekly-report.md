This is a sort of Weekly Report.

I have been having some issues trying to get py-gnome to build at version 2.16.0 and am working those with the upstream maintainers. I have also been working with dbus upstream maintainers on getting a working dbus for Mac OS X.

I won&rsquo;t be doing much by way of working on MacPorts in the coming weeks, as my wife and I are expecting our second child next week and she will rightfully be keeping away from this project.

I have two pleas while I&rsquo;m away. Can someone please look at the [Fink](http://fink.sf.net) port of Firefox 1.5.0.7 for X11 and get it ported into MacPorts? And can someone please begin working on getting those GNOME ports that are still at version 2.12.x up to version 2.16.x?
