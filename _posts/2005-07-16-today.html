<p>I submitted some patches to update some portfiles in <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org">DarwinPorts</a> today. Most of the GNOME Developer&rsquo;s Platform packages work with simple updates (changing only the version and the hash sum) to the portfiles.</p>

<p>What does not work simply:</p>

<p><strong>esound</strong>
    there were some patches made to the esound source to make it build on Mac OS X/Darwin. With the updated esound these patches don&rsquo;t work. After making new patches that do work, autoconf just blew up. I don&rsquo;t have the time to figure that one out.</p>

<p><strong>gtk-doc</strong>
    I do not understand xml catalogs at all. And when I did look at the docbook documentation, I just got a headache. Simply said, the lack of docbook catalogs on my system breaks gtk-doc.</p>

<p><strong>pkgconfig</strong>
    Version 0.18.1 simply could not find the libraries that version 0.17.2 had no problem finding without prompting.</p>

<p>Also (mostly) fixed the XHTML/CSS errors in the site. Blogger code still causes a couple of XHTML errors and some code from Apple that maintained compatibility with Netscape 4 series browsers simply had to go. Might fire up that browser one of these days just to see how horrible this site looks in it.</p>
