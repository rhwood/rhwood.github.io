<p>Way back when in late 2003, Kathy, my mother-in-law, bought us a digital camera so that we could send her pictures of her grandchild, due to be born in April 2004. We took the camera on a trip to visit Chrysta&rsquo;s father in December 2003 in Kansas City. I think that all of 6 photos survive from that trip. They are on the memory card that came with the camera, which we found recently. It is a 32MB card (we use a 512MB one now). There are a couple of pictures from Alexandria from about that time as well a set of very recent (as in last week) photos of our girls.</p>
