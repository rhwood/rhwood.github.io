<p>I recently began working at <a href="http://www.trustedcs.com">Trusted Computer Solutions</a> (TCS). TCS is (as I understand things) a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> shop transitioning from a being a <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/index.jsp">Solaris</a> shop.</p>

<p>But we run <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows</a> on most of our desktop computers.</p>

<p>I received permission to install <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a> on my Laptop as my primary operating system, and quickly set about doing so. So far I have only two significant problems with the computer:
1. <a href="http://www.vmware.com">VMWare Server</a> is slow when running our Linux systems. I think that we have stripped the OS down to a basic system for our purposes, so its not liking running in the virtual machine.
2. There is a whole infrastructure in place to support Windows users that is not well documented. (It just works in Windows, but not Linux.)</p>
