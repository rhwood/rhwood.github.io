Recently when Chrysta and I were driving in the country&ndash;one of the rare occasions when I was a passenger&ndash;we hit a butterfly on our windshield.

It was a yellow one with a large wingspan, and it bounced off the windshield, leaving some goo behind. I looked back for some other reason and there it was about 25 feet off the road flapping madly and spinning rapidly towards the road.

We must of thrown it at least 40 feet into the air.

It was a moment of sadness.
