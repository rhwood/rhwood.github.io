On the [Official Gmail Blog](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/) there is an article [9 reasons to archive](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/04/9-reasons-to-archive.html).

Ever since Mail.app 2.0 was released on Tiger and since I have been using Gmail, I have been leaving messages in my Inbox and using search filters to keep things clean.

This of course leads to a large inbox, which may have adverse effects on my self management. But this articles prompts another question: How do I use the Gmail Archive in an IMAP mail client?
