The night before last, Friday morning at about 0100 hours actually, I went to the emergency room with chest pains. While it turns out that it was not a heart failure or problem, my doctor is not sure what caused the pains.

At the time, I had been suffering from intense diarrhea for a few days, and was somewhat dehydrated. They pumped about 2.5 liters of IV into me during my early morning visit to the ER.

My doctor does allow for the possibility that simple stress could have caused the pains, but he can only really diagnose stress by negative elimination&hellip;

Either way, I&rsquo;m recovering rapidly now, but will have to learn how to vent stress in less harmful ways.
