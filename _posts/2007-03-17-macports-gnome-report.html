<p>I managed to, within 3 days of <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> releasing version <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.18">2.18.0</a>, get the entire current GNOME Platform into <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>. It actually took only a few hours work, and a day&rsquo;s waiting on compilers to get done.</p>

<p>I hope that getting the GNOME desktop into MacPorts is as painless as well.</p>

<p>Report 7</p>
