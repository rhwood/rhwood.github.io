<p>I know, I know. This seems more like a quarterly report than a weekly report, but it is more that I took a sabbatical from port maintenance than that I have been lazy with this report.</p>

<p>Almost all of the ported <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> packages are now at current stable versions! The big blocker on this was (and remains) <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org">d-bus</a>. It builds correctly, the d-bus glib bindings build correctly, but d-bus does not work correctly. Try running the test suite (<strong>make check</strong>) after building it and you&rsquo;ll see the problem.</p>

<p>I am planning on reworking the TODOs section of the <a href="http://svn.macosforge.org/projects/macports/wiki/GNOME">MacPorts GNOME</a> page such that it is up-to-date and every TODO is listed as a ticket in the tracker.</p>

<p>Report 6</p>
