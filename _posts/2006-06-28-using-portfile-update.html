<p>About 6 months ago, I threw together a script to help me automate the process of updating a Portfile for a package from <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> ftp servers. I called the script gport and wrote it in <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> simply because I knew that language.</p>

<p>I have been using that script to maintain the GNOME ports for the <a href="http://www.darwinports.org">DarwinPorts</a> project, thinking all the while that it might be useful if it was more generalized, tweaking it and adding some features during this time.</p>

<p>I usually used the script with the <code>-o</code> flag so that its output would scroll past in Console.app, and sometimes with the <code>-k</code> flag so that I could return the output log after the script had successfully updated the port. (By default it deletes a log if the update was successful, but keeps the log if it fails. This has allowed me to scan my copy of the CVS repository when using <a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/cvl/">CVL</a> for update failures, as CVL flags files not in CVS with a blue star.)</p>

<p>This past weekend, I rewrote the script to be a little more robust, and to update any Portfile (although automatic version determination only works for GNOME FTP server-based ports) and renamed it to be a little more meaningful.</p>
