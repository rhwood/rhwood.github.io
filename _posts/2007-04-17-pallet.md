Pallet is the beginnings of an attempt to write a usable and [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) for the [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) software porting system.

Pallet uses its own parser for the port indexes on your system, so it loads the ports list fast, but beyond that is not much help right now.

It builds and runs only on Mac OS X 10.4.x. I am using some Cocoa features that are not available on earlier versions of Mac OS X.

Right now the best way to get it is to install a working MacPorts system and then `sudo port install pallet`.
