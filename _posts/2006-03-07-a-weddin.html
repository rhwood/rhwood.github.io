<p>This weekend past I attended the wedding of my wife&rsquo;s step brother, one Brian by name. Augusta, my daughter participated.</p>

<p>She was the flower girl. Now, at 22 months of age she was intolerably cute. &lsquo;Specially in a little dress, sniffing the Tulips she was holding, holding the hand of the 4 year-old ring bearer.</p>

<p>That said, the weekend was difficult. We drove <em>way</em> too much. Augusta was at first livid at the amount of time spent in the car, crying and maybe even throwing a tantrum everytime we got in. Then she became simply sullenly resigned to it. But she seems to have now learned that the car is not some strange torture but a means to get from one place to another, just so long as she understands what that other place or activity is.</p>

<p>Even so, being strapped down is no fun at all.</p>
