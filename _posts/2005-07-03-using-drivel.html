<p>Using <a href="http://www.dropline.net/drivel/">Drivel</a>.</p>

<p>I think the only real advantage it has over the standard interface for my journal is that it can be used offline and synced up later. That is, if it lives up to its advertizing on my slightly broken installation.</p>

<p>I am using (as can be told by the URL for now) Blogger for my journal and do not like some of the user interface elements in it (such as a totally different look and feel for posting comments from the rest the blog), but really don&rsquo;t mind it much.</p>

<p>Well, anyway let&rsquo;s see how Drivel posts this entry&hellip;</p>

<p>It seems that Drivel does not allow me to title my journal entries and can be used only to record the entry. Later I will have to login to blogger and title everything. Nice and simple UI though&hellip;</p>
