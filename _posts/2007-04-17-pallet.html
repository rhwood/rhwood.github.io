<p>Pallet is the beginnings of an attempt to write a usable and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI</a> for the <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a> software porting system.</p>

<p>Pallet uses its own parser for the port indexes on your system, so it loads the ports list fast, but beyond that is not much help right now.</p>

<p>It builds and runs only on Mac OS X 10.4.x. I am using some Cocoa features that are not available on earlier versions of Mac OS X.</p>

<p>Right now the best way to get it is to install a working MacPorts system and then <code>sudo port install pallet</code>.</p>
