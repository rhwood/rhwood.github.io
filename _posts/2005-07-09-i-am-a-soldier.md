Hurry up and wait.

Bored without gun nor bullets,

I am a Soldier!

This is a quick Haiku that I doodled up while attending a mandated training session at work. Nobody claimed it was any good.

As the Haiku implies, I am a soldier. Outside of BCT (Basic Combat Training), I have handled my weapon (we don&rsquo;t call &lsquo;em guns&ndash;that simply fits the 5-7-5 structure), all of 4 times, and 3 of those times it merely for its monthly cleaning. In garrison, unless we are MPs or infantry, we don&rsquo;t see our weapons much.
