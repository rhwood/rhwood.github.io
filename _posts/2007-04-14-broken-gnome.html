<p>My <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>-based installation of <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a> is broken. It seems that when I installed KDE Office to verify that some GNOME packages that KDE Office uses were not breaking KDE Office once patched in MacPorts and then uninstalled KDE Office, that at-spi just broke.</p>

<p>Plus I am suffering some scrollkeeper/docbook build wierdness that is slowing the migration to GNOME 2.18 in MacPorts&hellip;</p>

<p>So anyway, I am axing my GNOME installation and my MacPorts installation and starting over from scratch this weekend.</p>
