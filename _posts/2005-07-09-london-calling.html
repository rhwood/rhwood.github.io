<p>Could not call my wife in Germany from Korea the night-for-me/morning-for-her when London was bombed. Korean Telecoms simply reported that the call could not be completed without even hitting the international circuits.</p>

<p>Had to keep track of what was going down for work as well. My section is responsible for tracking outside events that may effect my organization&rsquo;s activities. So far, the bombings have had no effect on operations.</p>

<p>Pulled out my London Calling LP and played it loud.</p>
