<p>Our old (and first) vacuum cleaner (a Eureka of some sort) died after 4 years.</p>

<p>We had bought our first vacuum cleaner at the Alexandria Target when we moved there, into our first apartment with carpeted floors.</p>

<p>We replaced it with a <a href="http://www.dyson.com/range/feature_frame.asp?model=DC17-ANIMAL&amp;sinavtype=menu">Dyson Animal</a> vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>Chrysta was so happy with the Dyson that I thought of titling this post &ldquo;I married my mother-in-law.&rdquo; She has a number of very expensive vacuum cleaners and still buys more. It seems the real difference (in regards to vacuums) between Chrysta and her mother is that Chrysta let me place the old vacuum out beside the garbage dumpster where someone quickly took it away&hellip;</p>
