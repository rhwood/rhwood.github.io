<p>Yesterday morning I upgraded my work laptop from Fedora 9 to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora">Fedora 10</a>. Other than a couple of issues outlined below, the experience seemed reasonable:</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>

<ul><li>The bootloader (grub) did not upgrade correctly, leaving me at a grub prompt when the computer started. Apparently this is a common issue. The fix was simple in my case:

<ol><li><code>root (hd0,1)</code></li>
<li><code>setup (hd0,1)</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMware Workstation</a> refused to heal from the upgrade. Usually VMware Workstation just heals itself after I update the kernel, but for some reason it refused to heal itself. Again a simple fix:</p>

<ol><li><code>rm /usr/lib/vmware/modules/binary</code></li>
<li><code>vmware modconfig --console --install-all</code></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Immediately after installing Fedora (on only the second day after its release) there were a ridiculous number of updates to be downloaded, so I basically the first thing I did with the system was let it download and install updates for three hours.</li>
</ul><h4>References</h4>
