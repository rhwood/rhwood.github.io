Today I finished clearing my unit except for the Final Out, the day before I fly to my next assignment since I fly at some ridiculously early hour on Tuesday. Going to spend the weekend packing and working on my continuity book and emailing myself swaths of stuff that I might find useful to keep.

My joy is tempered by the fact that I have either a kick-ass cold or an early flu.
