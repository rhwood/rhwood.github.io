<p>We visited the <a href="http://www.lewisginter.org/">Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden</a> today. Augusta had been demanding this week that we go to <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Richmond,+VA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;om=1&amp;ll=37.557642,-77.433701&amp;spn=0.279241,0.347443&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=addr">Richmond</a> to the <a href="http://www.c-mor.org">Children&rsquo;s Museum of Richmond</a> (she has been quoting their slogan from PBS: &ldquo;CMOR, DO MORE, BE MORE&rdquo;).</p>

<p>We had intended to visit the Garden during the morning and go to the museum in the afternoon, but instead spent all day at the Garden. It was awesome. Augusta had a blast. The military discounts were such that by purchasing a (military) family membership, we are saving money with the membership on just 3 visits a year (which will be absolutely no problem for us, thank you for asking).</p>

<p>Unfortunately we failed to take a camera with us, so there are no photos to share.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this garden, particularly if you have elementary school-aged or younger childern.</p>
