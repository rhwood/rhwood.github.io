I have finally overcome my fear of needles.

There are basically two ways to overcome a fear of needles (if you are, in fact, afraid of needles):

1. Become a Heroin addict, which I don&rsquo;t recommend.
2. Train to be a paramedic or combat life saver.

I am now a combat life saver. During our training we are both stuck by our fellow trainees (the standard is that we are capable of applying an IV to a patient) and stick our fellow trainees a minimum of two (2) times. Once you can stick without fear, you can be stuck without fear.

The loss of the fear was almost magical.
