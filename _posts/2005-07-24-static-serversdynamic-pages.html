<p>Any developer who has worked the web knows that different browsers render content differently. I remember back in the day working to make sure that things rendered with pretty pictures in Netscape, degraded nicely in Mosaic, and worked flawlessly in Lynx (Netscape 1 was released while I was in college and I remember taking a course on using and developing for the internet and showing the Professor this wonderful new tool called the web&hellip;but that&rsquo;s a story for a different time).</p>

<p>In any event, I wanted to display some content that is platform or browser specific, not in the sense that some browsers support x subset of some standard while others support y subset of the same standard, but in the sense that I only want display a &ldquo;Get Firefox&rdquo; button when the page is not viewed using <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=118911&amp;t=80">Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>This journal loads the code to handle this need, it&rsquo;s just that it requires 230 lines of code and three extra file loads (I have all my javascript code that I used loaded from separate files instead of imbedded in the pages to be a good network citizen). Most of the code is the browser detection code, which I simply lifted wholesale without modification from the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a>. They don&rsquo;t recommend using it of course; there are far better ways to test for working plug-ins or javascript capabilities. The other two files a couple of functions that abstract the process of creating a link with a random image and the code that contains a list of images, one of which is picked at random, to display.</p>

<p>Here is the code I wrote:</p>

<pre><code>function randomElementFromArray(theArray) {
        return theArray[Math.round(Math.random() * theArray.length - 1)];
}

function anchorWithRandomImage(anchor, images, altText) {
        return ('&lt;a href="' + anchor + '"&gt;&lt;img alt="' + altText + '" title="' + 
altText + '" src="' + randomElementFromArray(images) + '" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;');
}

function getFirefox() {
        var buttons = new Array(5);
        buttons[0] = "http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/88x31/trust.gif";
        buttons[1] = "http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/88x31/rediscover.gif";
        buttons[2] = "http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/88x31/take.gif";
        buttons[3] = "http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/88x31/get.gif";
        buttons[4] = "http://sfx-images.mozilla.org/affiliates/Buttons/88x31/safer.gif";
        if (!isIE3Mac &amp;&amp; (is.ie || is.opera)) {
                document.writeln(anchorWithRandomImage('http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=118911&amp;t=45', buttons, 'Get Firefox!'));
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty heavy into abstraction, so it could be combined into one function, but there it is. The code to create the &ldquo;is&rdquo; object used for browser detection was boosted from the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/sniffer/browser_type_oo.html">Mozilla sniffer code</a>.</p>
