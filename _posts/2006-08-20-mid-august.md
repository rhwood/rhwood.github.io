Things have been quiet of late. Its been more of the same-ol&rsquo;, same-ol&rsquo;.

I lie of course.

One of the realities of where I work is that basically I can&rsquo;t discuss what I learned there. Office gossip is always okay, but even then I have to check that I am not crossing the line and causing a breach or releasing information that can&rsquo;t be released. Like two weeks ago, I took a really interesting class on some of the hows and whys of my line of work, and the entire class is classified. Can&rsquo;t talk about it, write about it, and probably should not even think about it in unclassified environments.

That said, I have been working on driving a php-based website with data that is maintained using a Microsoft SharePoint Server. I have a generic PHP class that is used to gather data, but it remains somewhat incomplete, and I can&rsquo;t test it at home.

On the MacPorts side of things, I had been working on getting gnucash running in MacPorts, and then someone else got it working first. I ended up making his package a little more usable and committing his work to the CVS servers.
