<p>After <a href="http://shyramblings.tumblr.com/post/65038713155/a-jenkins-node-daemon-on-os-x">writing about some scripts I wrote</a> to allow <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> running on a <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=b70e8c306162d25af8a47771c9226cdedf99e94a">Linode</a> to schedule builds on my iMac, I continued to tweak those scripts until I realized that I could not maintain them in a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists">gist</a>. The updated scripts are <a href="https://github.com/rhwood/jenkins-slave-osx">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>If I didn&rsquo;t travel for work, I could have simply run a Jenkins server at home; however, since I travel, I could either:</p>

<ol><li>get a fixed IP address for my home network and run Jenkins on my iMac</li>
<li>run Jenkins on a Mac mini from <a href="http://www.macminicolo.net">macminicolo.net</a> or a similar provider</li>
<li>run a Jenkins server on a Linode and run a Jenkins slave on my iMac</li>
</ol><p>I choose the third option, but quickly discovered that I would need to either:</p>

<ol><li>get a fixed IP address for the slave and use SSH to connect the Jenkins server and slave (initiated by the server and supported by the Jenkins project)</li>
<li>manually start a JNLP slave on the iMac and use HTTPS to connect the server and slave (initiated by the slave and supported by the Jenkins project)</li>
<li>script the process of automatically starting a JNLP slave on the iMac (commented on, but not supported by the Jenkins project)</li>
</ol>
