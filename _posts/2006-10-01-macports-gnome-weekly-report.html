<p>This week I began porting the GNOME desktop to version 2.16.0</p>

<p>I have been mostly porting libraries, not applications, so until I get the entire set in sync, it is possible that some applications will either fail to build or crash until the entire set is in sync.</p>

<p>Port <a href="http://dbus.freedesktop.org">dbus</a> has been reverted back to version 0.61 from 0.92 since dbus-glib can not build until some fundamental fixes are in on the dbus 0.9x ports. I have filed bugs with the upstream maintainer against this.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe I would have more to report, but it seems that perhaps I should hold off until next week, by which time, I hope to be more comfortable with the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com/">Trac</a> ticket system that has replaced <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org">Bugzilla</a> on the MacPorts project.</p>

<p>Many things aren&rsquo;t working on my system due to the ongoing recovery from upgrading the gettext port and accidentally ripping out the older versions of that library.</p>

<p>Report 2</p>
