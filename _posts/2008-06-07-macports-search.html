<p>Last month, I created a <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=011837386708472035020:5lqtx6zp3qw">Google Custom Search</a> of the <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> websites: the project home, the  guide, the wiki, the tickets database, and the source code browser.</p>

<p>I had suggested using it within the MacPorts sites to the project managers, but have not heard any response one way or other, so here it is.</p>
