I was disappointed.

I visited the museum on Friday, May 26th, prime time for school groups and such to be visiting museums and generally making a day of things, and seemingly half the museum was closed for one reason or another or exhibits/demonstrations/stations (what is the science museum equivalent of a single painting in an art museum?) were &ldquo;not operational,&rdquo; &ldquo;being installed,&rdquo; or some similar and areas that seemed open turned out to be undergoing reorganization or some similar activity.

Worse, there were no indications that this was going on from the front or from the reception desk. Browsing the web site in retrospect indicates that next Friday some significant exhibits are closing for replacement with new exhibits so maybe I just visited at precisely the wrong time, but an indication that I was visiting at a sub-optimal time would have been nice, both at the museum and on the web.
