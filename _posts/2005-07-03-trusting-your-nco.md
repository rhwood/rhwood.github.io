If your NCO is pressuring his soldiers not to take correspondence courses but merely to take the tests for the correspondence courses (by using the handy scanned in tests of someone who completed the course before you) can you trust him not be cutting courners elsewhere?

If all the NCOs in your unit are doing the same can you trust your unit? What about the Army as a whole?
