<p>This past weekend, we rearranged the common area (a combined living room/dining room) to not block off the living room as a separate room. It created the impression of significantly more space, gave us impetus to hang all of the artwork that Denis and Ingrid brought with them last time they visited, and makes the apartment feel more like a home and less like a transient barracks. There are <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/randall.h.wood/RedoingTheLivingRoom">some photos</a>.</p>
