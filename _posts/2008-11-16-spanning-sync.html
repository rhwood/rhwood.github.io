<p>I use S<a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=8KYFFP">panning Sync</a> to synchronize the address book and calendars on my Macs with my <a href="http://www.google.com/accounts">Google accounts</a> (yes, that&rsquo;s plural - I have one Google account, and one account at a <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/">Google Apps</a> site). It has been working great, allowing me to use my <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac">iMac</a> as the central hub by which everything else just stays in sync.</p>

<p>However, it is not free software, and being a heavy user of GNOME and other open source software projects, I spent some time shopping around for a free solution that performed as well as this, as easily as this, and just failed to find one. It&rsquo;s the first software purchase that I have made other than Mac OS X in a long time, and I think its been worth it.</p>

<p>Spanning Sync recently (a few months ago actually) began encouraging users to advertise the software by offering a discount to both the referred-to user and the referring user.</p>
