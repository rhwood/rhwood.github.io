I recently began running again. I had fallen into this strange I feel bad because I don&rsquo;t exercise and I don't exercise because I feel bad loop, but I think I may have managed to break that&hellip;

In any event, yesterday was a very nice short (2 mile) run along the bike trail near my house. It was in the false dawn and cool and everything was still and muted. Right after I turned at the mile marker, a large intercontinental jet marked for Air France (I think) flew low and  slow overhead, and I could see the individual windows on the side, and hear the difference as the sound from each engine was added to the noise, and then it passed from sight behind trees, only to return again much farther away. It was a great feeling. I don&rsquo;t know what the jet had to do with it.
