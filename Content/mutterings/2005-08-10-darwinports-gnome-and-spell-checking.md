It doesn&rsquo;t happen.

The [DarwinPorts](http://darwinports.opendarwin.org) ports collection includes [aspell](http://aspell.net), but not [GtkSpell](http://GtkSpell.sourceforge.net) or [GnomeSpell](http://www.gnome.org) packages. So most of the Gnome software that supports spell checking apparently does not require it, and so I failed to notice that the software had no spell checking.

I guess I have a weekend project ahead of me making testable ports for GtkSpell and maybe GnomeSpell&hellip;
