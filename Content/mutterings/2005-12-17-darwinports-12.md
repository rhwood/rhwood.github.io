Darwinports released a new version of the port engine this week and it broke my scripts that maintain the [GNOME on Darwinports](http://homepage.mac.com/rhwood/gnome/darwinports.html) page. For some damned reason, the developers decided that tab-delimiting was not working, and so I had to rewrite my scripts to tokenize a string instead of simply exploding it into an array. Grr. Well, anyway things all work now.
