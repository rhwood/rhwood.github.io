I recently moved from Daegu, Korea to Charlottesville, Virginia, USA and then a month after that moved again within Charlottesville. A week or so after the second move, Chrysta and Augusta joined me in Charlottesville from Stuttgart, Germany.

Augusta was born while I was on a confidence course in BCT at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That evening my entire company was taken out to the sand pit to do some grass drills to celebrate her birth. I didn&rsquo;t get to see her until she was three weeks old. After that, I was shipped to a second training post and then sent to Korea for a yearlong dependents restricted tour.

Augusta and Chrysta moved during that time to stay with Chrysta&rsquo;s parents in Stuttgart.
