They have so conditioned me to &ldquo;Hollywood Endings&rdquo; that I find it difficult to handle movies that don&rsquo;t have the Hollywood ending, like, oh say, most every good movie I have seen recently, with possibly the exceptions of &ldquo;A Fistful of Dollars,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Few Dollars More&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Good, Bad, and the Ugly,&rdquo; which all had their own brand of lonesome but Hollywood ending. I mention those movies because I did them all just recently.

What led me to write this post was &ldquo;House of Hidden Daggers,&rdquo; and, thinking about it, &ldquo;Hero&rdquo; and although it will have a sweet ending, &ldquo;Shopgirl,&rdquo; wherein a character notes that &ldquo;In life, it is the pain that means the most&rdquo; or matters, or something similar. I&rsquo;ll have to actually look up the quote to get it right.
