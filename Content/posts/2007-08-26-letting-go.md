Chrysta is taking it harder than I am.

Augusta is spending a week with my mother. This is her first time away from home, and will be the first time that Chrysta has gone a day without her.

I have to admit that I am not taking this very hard, but also that I was not there for Augusta&rsquo;s first 18 months (she&rsquo;s 40 months old now)&ndash;gone with the Army.

I have no doubt that it will be much harder for me to let Isabella go when the time comes, as I have been there for her constantly.
