This past week has been LOOONNNNGGGG.

Without going into details, (my employer is really paranoid about leaking that which should not be leaked), things started rough and only got rougher.

My desks at both home and work are absolute messes now.

I can only hope that things will not be so bad next week, but I&rsquo;m not really all that optimistic about it either&hellip;
