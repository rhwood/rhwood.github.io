  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update:</strong> Use the <a href="https://github.com/rhwood/jenkins-slave-osx">Jenkins Slave for OS X</a> instead. It&rsquo;s based on these gists and has the benefit of being maintained.</p>

<p>I have been using <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a> (CI) with some Java-based projects, and recently setup Jenkins for CI for a OS X application. For the Java-based projects, running Jenkins on a <a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=b70e8c306162d25af8a47771c9226cdedf99e94a">Linode</a> works well, but the Linode-based Jenkins instance cannot build iOS or OS X applications.</p>

<p>Its easy to setup Jenkins to support <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds">distributed builds</a> with a OS X system as a slave, provided the master can initiate SSH communications to the slave. If, like me, your Jenkins master cannot initiate a connection with your slave (which is my desktop iMac), it is still trivial to configure the slave to use <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds#Distributedbuilds-LaunchslaveagentviaJavaWebStart">Java Web Start</a> (JNLP).</p>

<p>I generally followed <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/author/hstaudacher/">Holger Staudacher&rsquo;s</a> <a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2012/06/01/ups-and-downs-with-continuous-integration-for-ios-apps-jenkins-xcode-cobertura-and-testflight/">post on the subject</a>. However, he was frustrated by his inability to configure his Mac to automatically start the JNLP connection.</p>

<p>The following script launches the Jenkins slave service via Java Web Start after downloading the slave.jar file (thereby ensuring that the slave.jar is always the current version):</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4136130.js?file=slave.jnlp.sh'></script>

        shift

        RESULT=$?
        if [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then
                sleep 10

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I was mobilizing late last year (in mid-to-late December), I had an idea of an easy, simple app that I could write for the iPhone. It would serve a purpose both my wife and I had (tracking the length of my deployment in a single pie chart à la the <em>Deployment Donut</em> or <em>Donut of Misery</em>), and once written, I would not need to maintain it. It was a to be a <em>throwaway app</em>.</p>

<p>I think I first heard the term <em>throwaway app</em> on the <a href="http://ideveloper.tv/shows">MDN Show</a> in 2010. A throwaway app is an app that is written with comparatively little investment in the intention that it will require no maintenance or commitment, while possibly generating a little income. So I had this throwaway app that I submitted to Apple while sitting on an upper bunk in a 50-man tent over a sporadic wifi connection in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_Center_at_Manas">Manas</a>. If Apple approved it, I had a throwaway app, knew I could develop an app, and could contemplate writing other more complex apps that required commitment.</p>

<p>Well, maybe not. After Apple approved the app and I got it into the App Store (almost the day I arrived in theatre on my deployment), I quickly got a number of emails offering to review the app from questionable operations, and a week later got my first review.</p>

<p>One Star. Negative comment. The app disappointed. Additional reviews were equally negative.</p>

<p><strong>I had failed.</strong> I doubted that I could write an app. Even a simple one. Eventually I relaxed enough to think that I could recover from this, that I could fix the issues in the app, and at least get a positive comment about it.</p>

<p>In a few weeks, I managed to release the first update, which addressed not only the initial negative comments, but also a few issues I had noted over time and which managed to provide a revenue stream (an In-App Purchase that eliminated adds and allowed the app to display multiple pie charts).</p>

<p>I got positive reviews. And people actually upgraded the app—enough so that the app covered the costs of developing it (excepting my labor), and revenues from the app increase every month.</p>

<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve released two updates that address bugs. I am preparing an update to introduce some new features. Clearly the App is no longer a throwaway app<em>—</em>I am now committed to the app. Now if only I can figure out how to market it on the cheap&hellip;</p>

<p>Incidentally, the App in question is <a href="http://axsw.co/gdZJa6">Doing Time</a>, is currently well rated, and other than a support page for it, this is the first mention I&rsquo;ve made of it other than on the App Store itself. I deliberately attempted to avoid describing the app while writing this, since this essay is about a throwaway app that no longer exists, since it receiving active maintenance.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I fell in love with San Diego and California and Los Angeles all over again and again and again while on a business trip out to San Diego. First I fell in love with San Diego driving up the 163 towards Escondido from downtown, where I was staying in admittedly one of the cheaper feeling hotels I&rsquo;ve been in and definitely the cheapest feeling Hampton Inn I&rsquo;ve been in.</p>

<p>163 starts in downtown, on the wrong side of a hill from the coast and immediately dives through a narrow valley crossed by high bridges and I fell in love that morning and that evening I walked through the residential area between downtown and the airport and fell in love again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was mostly reclusive, up too early on the phone with the home office, driving to the work site just after sun up and leaving the work site at sun down and did not enjoy the place&mdash;what the Hell&rsquo;s the point of visiting paradise if your going to be stuck indoors without windows all day. I made a wrong turn onto the 805 and fell in love again when it cut through a hill and then was suddenly soaring above a built-up valley in the early evening and was then back into the hills.</p>

<p>My brother, Chandler, lives in Los Angeles and I drove up to LA to see him, and on the I-5 the drive was lovely until I crested some hill (I don&rsquo;t recall where) and saw looming ahead, the smog of LA.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>for some reason this sat as a draft for almost a year, and I forget what I wanted to write when I began writing it, so here it is.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s well&hellip;it&rsquo;s <em>Microsoft</em>.</p>

<p>Frequently I&rsquo;ll hear people refer to the product of a company with a single product (or a single predominant product or range of closely related products) by the company name (for example <a href="http://www.citrix.com/">Citrix</a> of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>). But (mostly non-technical) people also seem to refer to Microsoft products as just being <em>Microsoft.</em></p>

<p>Not only does Microsoft not have a single product, Microsoft has a range of duplicative products&mdash;products which perform the same task but which do so in inconsistent and sometimes even incompatible manners: Outlook and Outlook Express/Windows Live Mail (mutually exclusive support for differing mail servers or services), Office and Works (differing file formats for the same task), Outlook and Windows Address Book/Windows Live Contacts.</p>

<p>But its all called <em>Microsoft</em> and I think its that confusion between products and what is in the Operating System and what is not that has benefited Microsoft and made it really difficult for Apple and the various Linux distributions to supplant it.</p>

<p>I know this is a rough idea, and I&rsquo;ll return to it, but I just wanted to say that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I remember one summer at home&mdash;I think it was the summer of &lsquo;98&mdash;when a single lonely saxophone would play out over the roofs of the neighborhood in the evenings. It was one of the insanely beautiful moments that made Raleigh seem at so much more urbane and cosmopolitan than it seemed during the day.</p>

<p>In any event, yesterday was the first day of spring when doors and windows were flung open and people just stayed outdoors. Usually the music of balmy afternoons in my neighborhood is of a Mexican or Salvadorian flavor, and occasionally jazz or even classical music. Unfortunately this time it was abrasive sensationalist Hip-hop of the most banal and vulgar kind.</p>

<p>Somehow I managed to shutout the lyrics and think of that saxophone until the language was brought to my attention, and it kind of put a damper on the afternoon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday morning I upgraded my work laptop from Fedora 9 to <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora">Fedora 10</a>. Other than a couple of issues outlined below, the experience seemed reasonable:</p>

<h4>Issues</h4>

<ul>
<li>The bootloader (grub) did not upgrade correctly, leaving me at a grub prompt when the computer started. Apparently this is a common issue. The fix was simple in my case:

<ol>
<li><code>root (hd0,1)</code></li>
<li><code>setup (hd0,1)</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/">VMware Workstation</a> refused to heal from the upgrade. Usually VMware Workstation just heals itself after I update the kernel, but for some reason it refused to heal itself. Again a simple fix:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>rm /usr/lib/vmware/modules/binary</code></li>
<li><code>vmware modconfig --console --install-all</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Immediately after installing Fedora (on only the second day after its release) there were a ridiculous number of updates to be downloaded, so I basically the first thing I did with the system was let it download and install updates for three hours.</li>
</ul>
