I created a couple of minor apps for iOS under the name _Alexandria Software_ between 2011 and 2022. While Apple was running it's advertising on iOS business, those apps made enough money to cover the costs of developing them (other than labor), but once Apple shut down its advertising operations, I just lost money and time on them continiously.
